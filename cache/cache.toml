moody_raven = "“Grok, I loved the *Moody Raven Bookstore Ambience | Dark Academia Music to Work, Study | Relaxing Melancholic Piano* by Regnum Umbrae on YouTube—haunting piano with a melancholic, scholarly vibe. Suggest something similar, like *Dark Academia Piano | Rainy Days in the Library* by The Soul of Wind, or another dark academia piano track with rain or gothic tones. Next step: give me a YouTube-friendly title to search.”\n"

stock_sim = "“Grok, we’re working on DSCI 303 Project 03, Part A. I’ve got a `simulate_stock` function with start=500, rate=0.08, vol=0.3, days=60, seed=1, aiming for a final price of 514.44. It’s plotting daily prices with matplotlib. Next step: finish Part A by confirming the plot and price, then move to Part B’s `find_yield`.”\n"
grok-cache = "Grok, we’ve built a CLI tool in grok-cache/src/grok-cache.py with copy, list, and add commands using click, tomli, tomli_w, and pyperclip. It manages cache statements in grok-cache/cache/cache.toml, with sections like [music] and [projects]. I just tested adding entries, and it works—usage prints with no args. Next step: enhance add to optionally take a prompt as an arg (e.g., add <section> <key> <prompt>) instead of prompting interactively."
dsci-303-p3 = "Grok, we’re on DSCI 303 - Project 03 in a Jupyter notebook. Done: Part A (simulate_stock, 514.44 final), Part B (find_yield, 0.1196, 25 runs plotted), Part C (seeds for A, B, C highest), Part D (monte_carlo, 10k runs, final prices 118.05-505.91 percentiles). Using numpy, math, matplotlib.pyplot. Next step: Start Part E—check notebook for details, likely more Monte Carlo or setup for Part F’s two-stock comparison."
